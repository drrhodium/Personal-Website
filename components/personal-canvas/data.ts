I was binge-eating everything in sight‚Ä¶ and this time, it was showing up.\n\nWhen I got married in 2024, some wedding rituals expected me to go topless (thanks, tradition). And let‚Äôs just say ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt love what I saw in the mirror. It wasn‚Äôt just about vanity. It was about control. That moment flipped a switch.\n\nSo I got to work. Tracked my food, hit the gym, walked till my knees sent passive-aggressive signals, and slowly started transforming ‚Äî not just my body, but also my mindset. The abs are on their way (I swear), and the transformation video will drop soon. Stay tuned.",
